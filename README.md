Amanda Ghassai makes these really cool interactive pieces. She is currently studying at the Center for Bits and Atoms in the MIT media lab and I found all her pieces so fascinating. This piece is an origami simulator. I love how you truly feel you are folding the page as you move your mouse across the screen. I also love that you can change the color and texture of the "paper" making the artwork feel very personal and interactive.

I found this piece really interesting to watch. The artist places four wooden structures with a hammer attached and basically he uses computing to have the hammers hit each structure at different times and with different forces. This then creates the image of each structure teetering and about to fall over, but not quite. I thought it was a beautiful, metaphoric piece since it was also labeled "Machines that almost fall over" and I interpreted the piece to comment on the fragility of our society in this new age of computer technology.
